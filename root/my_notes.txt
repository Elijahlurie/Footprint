Questions/issues:
- where should i give credit to the illustrator of the doodles and to the sources for the actions?
  - make a credits page?
- what should we call action of the day posts
- when one of us changes one of the table structures, make sure to tell the other so we can have same databases
- where should category links fit in featured previews?

things to do:

- prevent featured previews from being listed again below (use a while loop instead of for?)
  - maybe dont implement until we have a larger amount of posts created?
- have admin form look different based on what category is chosen
  - category select is separate form, sets a session variable with chosen category
  - if category session variable is set, there are 3 options for how form will look...
    - hidden input with value set as session variable value for category choice or just remember the session variable that was set
  - adjust blog post function accordingly
  - make sure category session variable is unset at the right time
  - or.. have each category option link to a separate page with a big blog form. inputs are spaced out and styled so its like filling in the blanks of the blog page

bugs to fix:

styles/features to add at some point:
- include time in blog post date so that if 2 posted in one day they arent just arranged alphabetically
- have a nicer delete post ux
- have a way to edit blog posts
- loading screen if users connection is bad
- make input boxes border red when errors inputting
- change preview styles a bit when they are actively clicked on
- in fucntions where i check if phone number or title is already used, use in_array() instead of a loop to streamline code

cool extra features to add:
- track most popular posts and have a section for viewing them
- make sharing posts easy https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts/
- a tool for billionairs to find environmental charities that will use their money most effectively
- terms and conditions statement
- maybe add a way for users to text back if they completed action instead of having to log in on site
- give people actions personalized to their zipcode
- make count of total actions completed continuously update
- show users carbon impact of their assigned action and link to more info on why
  - what iimpact would be if everyone did it
  - have cool parallax scrolling effects on most pages
- make the special action of the day div >> maybe include in first 'update' of the site
  - maybe have a selection of a few actions for users to choose from
- Gharuv idea: give people little characters to level up and buy things for by completing actions to earn an in-game currency
  - would make site alot less simple and adult-oriented so maybe not
- have a place on the site with 5ish current news articles about the environment that are regularly refreshed
  - maybe send out as an action periodically to read one of the articles?
  - split into two columns, one for negative and one for positive stories
- 'cant complete this action? click here to get a new one'
- let users choose what time to be texted at
- if i connect it to other shopping websites, get addUsersExternally function in order
- use AI to give actions that people are more likely to complete and also that will be more relevant and effective for those people
  - use coolclimate.org calculator, enter the user zipcode to get avg emmissions for that area and see what would be best to fix for ppl living there
  - take action page shows most useful actions
- send texts over dm or snapchat instead if users want


Expenses:
 - Texting API, toll free number
  - twilio
  - Textlocal
- google api paid account
  - if its too expensive just do a timezone dropdown instead
