Questions/issues:
- where should i give credit to the illustrator of the doodles and to the sources for the actions?
- what should we call action of the day posts
- should featured posts just be the most recent posts or should we hand pick them?
  - we should hand pick them, what should the mechanism be for doing that?
- should feautred posts also be listed below with their sections?
- should deleted posts also be deleted from directory? or keep them as a backup just in case
  - if keeping them as a backup, have a hidden div with all the info from the table in case we want to repost
  - if keeping the files, make sure they cant be accessed by typing in the url
    - have a php check at top of blog page if(blog post row deleted = true) then redirect? that means not actually deleting the row in table but just entering a 1 in that column

- a tool for billionairs to find environmental charities that will use their money most effectively
- more security, terms and conditions statement

- give people actions personalized to their zipcode
- make count of total actions completed continuously update
- show users carbon impact of their assigned action and link to more info on why
  - what iimpact would be if everyone did it
  - have cool parallax scrolling effects on most pages
- make the special action of the day div >> maybe include in first 'update' of the site
  - maybe have a selection of a few actions for users to choose from
- Gharuv idea: give people little characters to level up and buy things for by completing actions to earn an in-game currency
  - would make site alot less simple and adult-oriented so maybe not
- have a place on the site with 5ish current news articles about the environment that are regularly refreshed
  - maybe send out as an action periodically to read one of the articles?
  - split into two columns, one for negative and one for positive stories
- 'cant complete this action? click here to get a new one'
- let users choose what time to be texted at
- if i connect it to other shopping websites, get addUsersExternally function in order
- use AI to give actions that people are more likely to complete and also that will be more relevant and effective for those people
  - use coolclimate.org calculator, enter the user zipcode to get avg emmissions for that area and see what would be best to fix for ppl living there
  - take action page shows most useful actions
- send texts over dm or snapchat instead if users want
