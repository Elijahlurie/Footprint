  - get Blair Conklin to shout it out on insta/youtube?
- look into copyright, terms and conditions
- start developing some of the 'cool features to add'
- start a newsletter?
- at some point go through php and streamline code / fix logic errors

bugs to fix:
- error messes for empty inputs sometimes doesnt work on category form
- signup and login look weird on nates browser
- blog page doesnt automatically reload if a preview is deleted bc the file doesnt exist
- problems will arise if 2 ppl try to post at same time bc code just gets the most recent preview made to sub in values for the category form
- if i make a preview and go to category post page and then go to blog page, preview gets deleted bc of check on blog page but the session variables save my progress for the category form.
  - give a warning if user tries to leave category page halfway through?
  - or just automatically delete preview and unset session variables if they leave halfway through?


styles/features to add at some point:
- make input boxes border red when errors inputting
- unset session variables for category form inputs if post is successfully created?
  - doesnt rly matter bc they are only shown if a new error session variable is set but to clear up clutter of session variables
- loading screen if users connection is bad
- have a way to edit blog posts
- have a nicer delete post ux
- if errors on forms, only sub in the users' inputs for the boxes where they typed; for the empty ones leave in placeholders
- prevent featured previews from being listed again below (use a while loop instead of for?)
  - only once we have plenty of posts
- have the top part of aotd posts generated automatically if we include more data on each action in the database
- give a warning if admin tries to leave category page halfway through bc if they go to blog page the preview will be deleted and $_SESSION['created_preview'] will be unset so their progress will be lost
- delete session variables for filling in blanks on category pages if the $_SESSION['created_preview'] is unset bc they wont be able to revisit that page anyway unless they create a new post?
  - only reason not to would be if preview accidentally gets deleted so admin goes to form and makes new preview to be rerouted to category form in hpes that their progress is still there
  - but if trying to make a brand new post it will be annoying to have that there
- in fucntions where i check if phone number or title is already used, use in_array() instead of a loop to streamline code
- improve code for assigning actions and displaying actions because as of now if an action row in the middle of the table is deleted it messes things up


cool extra features to add:
- track most popular posts and have a section for viewing them
- make sharing posts easy https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts/
- a tool for billionairs to find environmental charities that will use their money most effectively
- terms and conditions statement
- maybe add a way for users to text back if they completed action instead of having to log in on site
- give people actions personalized to their zipcode
- make count of total actions completed continuously update
- show users carbon impact of their assigned action and link to more info on why
  - what iimpact would be if everyone did it
  - have cool parallax scrolling effects on most pages
- make the special action of the day div >> maybe include in first 'update' of the site
  - maybe have a selection of a few actions for users to choose from
- Gharuv idea: give people little characters to level up and buy things for by completing actions to earn an in-game currency
  - would make site alot less simple and adult-oriented so maybe not
- have a place on the site with 5ish current news articles about the environment that are regularly refreshed
  - maybe send out as an action periodically to read one of the articles?
  - split into two columns, one for negative and one for positive stories
- 'cant complete this action? click here to get a new one'
- let users choose what time to be texted at
- if i connect it to other shopping websites, get addUsersExternally function in order
- use AI to give actions that people are more likely to complete and also that will be more relevant and effective for those people
  - use coolclimate.org calculator, enter the user zipcode to get avg emmissions for that area and see what would be best to fix for ppl living there
  - take action page shows most useful actions
- send texts over dm or snapchat instead if users want


Expenses:
 - Texting API, toll free number
  - twilio
  - Textlocal
- google api paid account
  - if its too expensive just do a timezone dropdown instead
- web hosting
