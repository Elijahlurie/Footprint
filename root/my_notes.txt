bugs to fix:


styles to add:

cool features to add:
- a tool for billionairs to find environmental charities that will use their money most effectively
- more security, terms and conditions statement
- maybe add a way for users to text back if they completed action instead of having to log in on site
- give people actions personalized to their zipcode
- make count of total actions completed continuously update
- show users carbon impact of their assigned action and link to more info on why
  - what iimpact would be if everyone did it
- add more content to site
  - blog format, have educational content
    - make that content into youtube vids
- make the special action of the day div >> maybe include in first 'update' of the site
  - maybe have a selection of a few actions for users to choose from
- Gharuv idea: give people little characters to level up and buy things for by completing actions to earn an in-game currency
  - would make site alot less simple and adult-oriented so maybe not
- have a place on the site with 5ish current news articles about the environment that are regularly refreshed
  - maybe send out as an action periodically to read one of the articles?
  - split into two columns, one for negative and one for positive stories
- 'cant complete this action? click here to get a new one'
- let users choose what time to be texted at
- if i connect it to other shopping websites, get addUsersExternally function in order
- use AI to give actions that people are more likely to complete and also that will be more relevant and effective for those people
  - use coolclimate.org calculator, enter the user zipcode to get avg emmissions for that area and see what would be best to fix for ppl living there
  - take action page shows most useful actions
- send texts over dm or snapchat instead if users want


Expenses:
 - Texting API, toll free number
