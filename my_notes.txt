Questions/issues:
- where should i give credit to the illustrator of the doodles and to the sources for the actions?
  - make a credits page?
- how do we still maintain the security of having pages reload on pageback but still make it convenient so if theyre on blog page they dont lose their place

things to do:

- add cron job in hosting platform so that cron_functions gets run every 5 minutes
  - https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/web-hosting/how-to-automate-functions-on-your-website-with-cron-jobs/
- when ready to upload site activate the texting function
  - upgrade twilio account
  - change $twilio_number to the number i buy (in adduser and cron functions)
  - do the webhook thing
- buy google api
- once hosting is set up:
  - register email
  - change connection.php to connect to new database
  - change url in reply_sms.php to new website url
  - adjust sms action message to new url (in adduser and cron functions)
  - adjust text friend link action
  - change email in footer
  - make sure 404 page works
- Launch site!!
- Maybe remove learn abt maximizing battery after like 10 days bc it would be bad for ppl to get that one more than once
- post social media content, build up hype, link accounts in footer
  - get Blair Conklin to shout it out on insta/youtube?
- start developing some of the 'styles/features to add at some point' and then 'cool features to add'
- start a newsletter?
- Finish donate page
  - write content
  - style
  - set up paypal for Footprint? or Stripe? https://www.customdonations.com/support/pricing/
- at some point go through php and streamline code / fix logic errors

bugs to fix:
- css html scroll-behavior:smooth on blog page isnt working
- category form logic:
  - if i make a preview and go to category post page and then go to blog page, preview gets deleted bc of check on blog page
    - give a warning if user tries to leave category page halfway through?
    - or just automatically delete preview and unset session variables if they leave halfway through?
  - if there is an error on a category form all the source inputs are erased
  - if admin makes a preview, leaves category form page, and makes another preview, both category forms will be creating a file for the newest preview created on that computer bc its one session variable being shared
  - error message on category form doesnt show up the first time


styles/features to add at some point:
- lock login / password recovery forms after a certain amount of incorrect guesses
- make input boxes border red when errors inputting
- have max character counts for title and description inputs in admin page, have a little number in the corner of the textbox counting down
- unset session variables for category form inputs if post is successfully created?
  - doesnt rly matter bc they are only shown if a new error session variable is set but to clear up clutter of session variables
- loading screen if users connection is bad
- have a way to edit blog posts
- error message if admin doesnt add any sources for aotd posts
- have a nicer delete post ux
- prevent featured previews from being listed again below (use a while loop instead of for?)
  - only once we have plenty of posts
- have the top part of aotd posts generated automatically if we include more data on each action in the database
- give a warning if admin tries to leave category page halfway through bc if they go to blog page the preview will be deleted and $_SESSION['created_preview'] will be unset so their progress will be lost
- in fucntions where i check if phone number or title is already used, use in_array() instead of a loop to streamline code
- improve code for assigning actions and displaying actions because as of now if an action row in the middle of the table is deleted it messes things up
- alot of code can be simplified by using jquery/ajax i think to access server w/out reloading page,  no need for hidden inputs?


cool extra features to add:
- on dashoard show how many others have completed it and regions where most poeple are completing the action
- have nav tag link of current page be a lighter color or be underlined
- turn statistic numbers into words https://marc.info/?l=php-general&m=99928281523866&w=2
- use css transitions to make cool hover design features on elements
- track most popular posts and have a section for viewing them
- make sharing posts easy https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts/
- a tool for billionaires to find environmental charities that will use their money most effectively
- terms and conditions statement
- maybe add a way for users to text back if they completed action instead of having to log in on site
- give people actions personalized to their zipcode
- make count of total actions completed continuously update
- show users carbon impact of their assigned action and link to more info on why
  - what impact would be if everyone did it
  - have cool parallax scrolling effects on most pages
- make the special action of the day div >> maybe include in first 'update' of the site
  - maybe have a selection of a few actions for users to choose from
- Gharuv idea: give people little characters to level up and buy things for by completing actions to earn an in-game currency
  - would make site alot less simple and adult-oriented so maybe not
- have a place on the site with 5ish current news articles about the environment that are regularly refreshed
  - maybe send out as an action periodically to read one of the articles?
  - split into two columns, one for negative and one for positive stories
- 'cant complete this action? click here to get a new one'
- let users choose what time to be texted at
- if i connect it to other shopping websites, get addUsersExternally function in order
- use AI to give actions that people are more likely to complete and also that will be more relevant and effective for those people
  - use coolclimate.org calculator, enter the user zipcode to get avg emmissions for that area and see what would be best to fix for ppl living there
  - take action page shows most useful actions
- send texts over dm or snapchat instead if users want
- make the site feel more collaboarative bc it encourages collective action
  - show people how many actions have been completed in their area - ppl want to collaborate more when it feels like a smaller group
- once we have a lot of users, instead of everyone in US for the stats do if everyone in the footprint userbase did it today
